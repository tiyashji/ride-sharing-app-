# ride-sharing-app-
This project is a mini ride-sharing application inspired by platforms like Ola and Uber, designed using Java OOP concepts. The system allows users to select a ride type—bike or car—and enter the travel distance. The rides are represented by an abstract Ride class with private fields for driver name, vehicle number, and distance.
